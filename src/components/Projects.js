                            Over the past two years, I have been part of a high performance computing team
                            representing Wake Forest at competitions. Both years, I have acted as the team captain due to my
                            technical experience and my desire to lead. My primary technical role on the team
                            has been benchmarking, specifically the CUDA implementations of HPL and HPCG.
                            This involves careful power monitoring, hardware tuning and software adjustments.
                            I have done extensive bash scripting as a result of this both for install scripts
                            and run files. Here is an <a href="https://news.wfu.edu/2019/10/25/wfu-awards-and-recognitions-briefs-33/" style={{color: "red"}}>article</a> describing our work as a team.

                            I am building a Swift app to track and display gym usage at Wake Forest. This is being 
                            built to to help students find lower traffic times to use the gym. Iâ€™ve built the backend 
                            in Java and it runs on AWS. The backend keeps track of the current usage at a given time 
                            and stores that data so it can be used to visualize trends over time. The app displays 
                            both the current number of students in the gym and a graph with the running average of users
                            in an area of the gym throughout the day.

                            As part of a Software Engineering class I took at Wake Forest, one of the semester 
                            objectives was to build a working software product using the Agile development methodology. 
                            We built an iOS app that was essentially the student run, campus equivalent to UberEats. 
                            My role on the project was the lead Swift developer. I was the only one on my team who 
                            had any experience working in the language so I not only did a majority of the development 
                            but I also helped teach my other teammates about Swift and iOS development. I really 
                            love the leader role in a team since it allows me to assist my team members and make 
                            critical decisions when needed.
