                            Over the past two years, I have been part of a high performance computing team
                            representing Wake Forest. Both years, I have acted as the team captain due to my
                            technical experience and my desire to lead. My primary technical role on the team
                            has been benchmarking, specifically the CUDA implementations of HPL and HPCG.
                            This involves careful power monitoring, hardware tuning and software adjustments.
                            I have done extensive bash scripting as a result of this both for install scripts
                            run files.

                            I am building a Swift app to track and display gym usage at Wake Forest. This is being 
                            built to help students to work out during less busy times.  Iâ€™ve built the backend in 
                            Java and it runs on AWS. The backend keeps track of the current usage at a given time 
                            and stores that data so it can be used to visualize trends over time. The app allows user 
                            to view a graph that shows the average number of students in an area of the gym throughout 
                            the day given a day of the week.

                            As part of a Software Engineering class I took at Wake Forest, one of the semester 
                            objectives was to build a working software product using the Agile development approach. 
                            We built an iOS app that was essentially the student run, campus equivalent to UberEats. 
                            My role on the project was the lead Swift developer. I was the only one on my team who 
                            had any experience working in the language so I not only did a majority of the development 
                            but I also helped teach my other teammates about Swift and iOS development. I really 
                            love the leader role in a team since it allows be to assist my team members and make 
                            critical decisions when needed.
