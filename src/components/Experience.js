                        Fluid HPC is a platform allowing researchers to easily scale high performance computing workloads on the AWS
                        cloud. I worked as the lead for managing the operating system our customers work on. This included installing
                        necessary HPC software, increasing scaling efficiency, and building demos for customers. I worked extensively
                        on AWS primarily using computing and scaling resources such as EC2, S3, ParallelCluster and CloudFormation.
                        Additionally, I frequently met with customers to discuss timelines and goals for specific projects as the technical
                        lead.

                        framework. I also completely a few stories doing backend work with NodeJS. I worked alongside senior
                        developers to resolve open tickets and fix bugs. My final role was to assist in the quality assurance process to
                        ensure a stable release application.
