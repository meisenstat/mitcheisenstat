                        Fluid HPC is a platform allowing researchers to easily scale high performance computing workloads on the AWS
                        cloud. I worked as the lead for managing the operating system our customers work on. This included installing
                        necessary HPC software, increasing scaling efficiency, and building demos for customers. I worked extensively
                        on AWS primarily using computing and scaling resources such as EC2, S3, ParallelCluster and CloudFormation.
                        Additionally, I frequently met with customers to discuss timelines and goals for specific projects as the technical
                        lead.

                        framework. I also completed a few stories doing backend work with NodeJS. I worked alongside senior
                        developers to resolve open tickets and fix bugs. I assisted in the quality assurance process to
                        ensure a stable release application.

                        TextRecruit is a candidate engagement platform that leverages text, chat and AI to hire better people, faster. I 
                        worked as an AI Specialist Intern, leading a team of entry level engineers and college students to build out 
                        the AI chatbot called Ari that the TextRecruit platform uses. Ari assists recruiters 
                        in announcing job openings, screening candidates, scheduling interviews, onboarding new employees and answering 
                        frequently asked HR questions. A majority of my time was spent building out this chatbot 
                        but as the team grew I acted as a team lead/manager, as well as interacting with customers.
